    ''' the sort order for the memory array has been previously defined. Memory arrays associated with an SAFGrid

    ''' All other memory arrays must have their sort order explicitly defined via one of several different methods.
    ''' Each of the methods to define a key field, such as MKey, MKeyFld, MKeyHctl and MKeyOffset, vary primarily
    ''' in the way they acquire detailed information on a key field such as datatype, size and byte offset within

    ''' fields but it is also the most detailed to code. It is designed to facilitate the definition of a key field
    ''' that does not exist in the database and therefore has no correlated data dictionary information in the
    ''' database. This situation can occur if one of the user-defined datatypes in a memory array is only declared
    ''' within VB and does not exist within the database. In such a case, the system has no way of determining the
    ''' byte offset from the beginning of the structure for any particular field, the field datatype nor the length
    ''' of the field. The MKeyOffset statement allows the developer to explicitly pass all of this detailed information
    ''' relating to the designated key field since it does not exist in the SQL data dictionary. Multi-segment keys
